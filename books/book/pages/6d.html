        As she was so successful at improving the hospital, and she carefully collected data about all the care the soldiers were now receiving, Florence collected her thoughts and discoveries and put them in a large report that suggested reforms for other military hospitals. The report would spark a massive restructuring of the British Governmentâ€™s War Office and the creation of a new body to look into the health of the army.

				Whilst we all saw the hospital improve due to Florence's hard work, her careful records showed that the number of patients dying was not decreasing significantly: there four thousand deaths that winter. As she had highlighted the importance of hygiene in keeping patients healthy, in the Spring, the British Government sent engineers to clear the sewers beneath the hospital and improve ventilation. This was repeated in other army hospitals and the death rate finally began to fall.
      </p>
      <p>
				A combination of hygiene practices that Florence had introduced (like hand washing) and the clearing of sewers saw a drop in the death rate from 42% (almost half of all those admitted were dying) to 2%. When I heard that, I realised how lucky I was: to be alive and to be under the care of Florence.
