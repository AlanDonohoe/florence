        Florence worked 20 hours a day. She went into town to buy fresh food and enlisted a French chef, Monsieur Soyer, to cook proper meals for the soldiers. She managed to get hundreds of scrubbing brushes and even asked the patients who could walk to scrub the hospital floors, walls and surfaces.

				At night, she would walk the wards talking to the soldiers and writing letters home for those who could not write. The soldiers were happy to be treated with the care and respect that they deserved.

				Florence was ambitious in her plans and didn't let anyone who might say,  "…you can’t do that…" to get in the way of her important work. She invented a number of services such as a specialist kitchen that provided food for patients with special dietary needs, she set up a laundry, a classroom and a library.
