      <span class="firstcharacter">A</span>fter a few weeks, I was moved into another ward in the barracks hospital: my condition was improving and I had to give my bed up to someone worse off than me. I spent a long time here, waiting for my body to repair. The hospital was dirty and overcrowded. I entered the war thinking that I would die by being shot and I was now scared of dying of typhus, typhoid, cholera or dysentery. You were ten times more likely to die of a disease caught in the hospital than you were from being killed in battle. I had watched a lot of men die from disease around me... Still, my pain subsided and I could at least sleep at night now. I wasn't sent back to the battlefields as my wounds got infected: man, they itched like hell.

      We were all so far away from home; it was lonely out in here in Crimea, even with the other British soldiers to talk to. We were forced to wait, impatiently daydreaming of home, for any letters or news. 

      One piece of good news was that Florence's letter had been published by a national newspaper and it looked like the British Government was going to improve things out here. We learned that the engineer Brunel was building a new type of hospital, one that could be built in Britain and then shipped out here. Florence had also improved the conditions in the hospital in other ways. Due to her demands, a team came over from Britain and flushed out the broken sewers and fixed the ventilation so that the smell of the toilets was gone and there was fresh air in the wards instead of coughs and sneezes from injured soldiers. That sorted out some of the men. They looked healthier already. 

      Florence's stubbornness also meant we had beds, rather than left on stretchers on the ground, with clean white sheets, rather than dirt and blood-stained rags. She and her nurses cleaned the whole hospital, top to bottom. There was hardly any flies, or maggots and no one had seen a rat or a mouse in long time.
