				As her health deteriorated she had to pay for private nurses to come and tend to her. She realised that most people were not as rich as her and so would not have such a luxury. To help those that had to look after themselves or their own family, her book: "Notes on Nursing", helped educate people about how to care for sick relatives. She also campaigned to improve the sanitation for poorer neighbours up and down the country.
