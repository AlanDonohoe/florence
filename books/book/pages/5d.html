        Florence was asked by her friend Sydney to help out. Her old friend was now an important figure in the British government: Sidney Hilbert, The Secretary of War. She was to lead a team of almost forty nurses to the war in Crimea to look after the injured British soldiers. It was the first time women had been allowed to officially serve in the army. She quickly assembled a group of willing nurses and nuns and they set sail within days. They arrived in Turkey in November '54. Which is where she is now… sitting talking to me.

				When she first arrived at the hospital she said that the Army doctors were not interested in listening to anything she had to say. 'A nurse?' 'A woman!!??' But she wouldn’t go quietly and she didn’t give up. Eventually the doctors let her and her nurses into the hospital at Scutari, in Constantinople/Istanbul, Turkey (where we were based away from the battlefields, with our Turkish comrades). Despite being warned… what they saw shocked every one of them.
