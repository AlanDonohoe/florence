      <span class="firstcharacter">I</span> was shot in my thigh. The bullet passed through me once and then got stuck in my other leg. I didn't know this at the time, only later. I noticed my legs stop working first. My run towards the gunfire stopped and turned into my collapsing into the mud, down a hole in the earth scooped out by the cannons' fire, down into broken pieces of wood half sticking out of the ground. I rolled over and over myself and I could feel my warm blood pump down my leg as the long tails of my jacket wrapped around my head and neck. I felt something snap as I reached out and tried to grab anything. My rifle was lost somewhere by now. I think I felt it bang on my back but that could of been a piece of the wood that I was now tumbling through. Over and over I turned, until I hit the bottom. Everything was a complete mess. 

I passed out. 

Time passed, I don't know how much. Felt like a long time.

I could feel my whole body moving as if on a train: straight forward with some bumps and dips. There was distant gunfire and shouting and men talking around me. I managed to open my eyes but could not lift my head without extreme pain gripping my neck. I looked at the sky above me and the sides of the men carrying me. I knew I was seriously hurt. I passed out again.

I woke up. I was still and I could feel the solid earth below. I could hear moaning and screams and so I turned my head slightly to see where I was. I was inside a building, there was the brick walls of the old army fort and rows of soldiers wounded in various degrees. I knew that the army had converted the old Selimiye army barracks into a hospital and that it wasn't really built for such a task. There was filth and a terrible smell of sickness and waste. We were left lying on the floor in pools of blood and dirt. Flies and maggots were over some's wounds and the sheet that covered me was grey with grime and blotted with old blood.
