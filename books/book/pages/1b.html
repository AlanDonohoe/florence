      <span class="firstcharacter">I</span> was shot in my thigh. The bullet passed through me once and then got stuck in my other leg. I didn't know this at the time, only later. I noticed my legs stop working first. My run towards the gunfire stopped and turned into my collapsing into the mud, down a hole in the earth scooped out by the cannons' fire, down into broken pieces of wood half sticking out of the ground. I rolled over and over myself and I could feel my warm blood pump down my leg as the long tails of my jacket wrafont-weight: normalpped around my head and neck. I felt something snap as I reached out and tried to grab anything. My rifle was lost somewhere by now. I think I felt it bang on my back but that could of been a piece of the wood that I was now tumbling through. Over and over I turned, until I hit the bottom. Everything was a complete mess.

    <p>
      I passed out. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed, I don't know how much. It felt like a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could feel my whole body moving as if on a train: straight forward with some bumps and dips. There was distant gunfire and shouting and men talking around me.
