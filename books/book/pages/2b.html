      <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>t was so dark all I could see was the outline of bodies lying in beds. I could see some of their chests moving up and down... I couldn't tell if the other bodies were still breathing. 

      I had not slept for hours, maybe even days: such was the pain from my injuries. I was cut, bruised and I had broken bones. It's hard to sleep when every time you move you feel a bolt of pain shoot through your body. Even when you lie still, the pain throbs like a hot light, slowly being turned on and off. The pain makes you feel sick... I was exhausted.

      My eyes just wanted to fall shut and every time they did the comforting blanket of sleep would roll from my closed eyes, to the front of my brain and gently sweep to the back... wonderful sleep... a medicine that would ease my pain and exhaustion. But it was brief. Soon a cough or a groan, would wake me and my pain and I would be reunited. 

      I was watching the hours slide nowhere in the darkness of the hospital ward, when I noticed a gentle light glowing in the corridor. Dipping up and down and growing brighter, the nurse we called, "The Lady with the Lamp" was coming round for her nightly checks. Quietly, as if on tip toes, she would stop at each bed and check the condition of the injured soldier lying there. There was about ten of us in the ward and I waited for her to get round to me.  She was in charge of about 40 volunteers who she had trained as nurses and another 15 nuns who had all come from Britain to help in the hospital a few weeks ago. 

      As she placed her lamp on the floor next to my bed, she whispered: "Hello Major, how are you feeling tonight?" 
      I spoke in between gasps of air whilst clenching my teeth: "Hello Ma'am. I am still in as much pain here and here", [pointing to my leg and chest] "as last night. I can not sleep because of it... Is there anything you can do to help me?" 
      She placed her hand on her chin, taking a moment to look at the broken man in front of her and then took the notes beside my bed up and looked through them.
      "I'm sorry you are suffering. You know the doctors are doing everything they can for you and the others. They are low on supplies, medicine and painkillers. They themselves hardly sleep and are overworked. With all the injured the war produces, they are finding it hard to help you all."
      "I am trying though... I can't stop the war but I have written to the newspapers about the terrible conditions and I am praying that the attention we get, will help us to transform this hospital to place of healing rather than a place of suffering."

      Once she had read through my notes she put them back and produced a damp cloth from her kit. She carefully wiped clean my face and then replaced the bandage on my leg with a clean one.

      "Good night Major. Try and get some sleep."
      "Good night Florence. Thank you."

      She picked up her lamp and moved to the injured soldier in the next bed. I fell back into darkness again and I think I finally, briefly, did get some sleep.
