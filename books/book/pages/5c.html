        It was part of my job to keep my troops in good spirits but this was hard and I couldn't lie: we weren’t given the support we should of got and many were falling because of it. Word got out back home about the terrible conditions. The Times newspaper reported that soldiers were dying of hunger and cold and that there wasn't proper medical care for soldiers injured after battle. As previous female nurses had such a bad reputation, for being drunk, et cetera, those in charge refused to hire any more so there wasn’t any nurses to tend to sick. The doctors would patch you up and then you were more or less left to it. But without nurses more soldiers were dying from diseases than in battles and now the British public was outraged by how poorly their soldiers were being treated.
