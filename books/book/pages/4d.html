        Florence told me, “As I grew up and turned from a girl into a woman, I had three marriage proposals! There was Harry, who I politely declined; Richard, who was friends with me for nine years but again… I politely declined; and Sir Harry, who again I declined. He ended up marrying my sister Pop!”

        Such was her dedication to her calling she was determined not be led off the course of her vision: of helping others and eventually reforming nursing. When Florence first thought about the best way to help others and decided nursing was the path for her to take, her parents forbid her and were angry that their daughter, who they had raised and had so many expectations of, would take such a job. Nursing was not respected and hospitals were filthy. Nurses were not trained and someone of them were drunk at work. Why would their daughter choose to work in a hospital?

        “They sent me away to Italy to try and make me forget about becoming a nurse. But in Rome I met my friend Sidney, who convinced me to continue to pursue becoming a nurse. It was the duty of rich people to help the poor, he told me.”
