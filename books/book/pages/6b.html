They was not enough beds so men lay on stretchers and on the floor, unwashed, in their own waste. The building was over a large cesspit and now the drains were blocked, rats and insects were everywhere and the smell was terrible. The troops were used to having to eat mouldy bread and old, tough meat and live in disgusting conditions. There was no one who could fight to change things. Until Florence.

She would do whatever it took to stop the senseless suffering and death.
